# ReactQuizApp

This project is a quiz application developed using React, Redux (with Redux Toolkit), React Router, Axios, and Sass.

## Description

ReactQuizApp is a Single Page Application (SPA) built with React, aimed at providing an interactive and engaging way for users to take quizzes. The application features a robust state management system using Redux Toolkit and employs React Router for seamless navigation between different sections of the app. Axios is used for handling HTTP requests, and the styling is done using Sass for modular and maintainable CSS.

## Functionality

- **Create and Take Quizzes**: Users can create quizzes. They can also take quizzes and get instant feedback on their answers.
- **User Authentication**: The app includes user authentication, allowing users to sign up, log in, and manage quizzes.
- **Results Tracking**: Users can track their quiz results and see statistics.
- **Responsive and Modern Design**: The user interface is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, providing an intuitive experience across different devices.

## Technologies and Tools

- **React**: The main library used for building the user interface.
- **Redux (Redux Toolkit)**: For state management.
- **React Router**: For handling routing within the application.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend.
- **Webpack**: For bundling and optimizing the code, enabling modular styling with CSS modules.
- **Jest**: For writing unit tests and ensuring code quality.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project was to enhance my skills in React and modern web development practices. Through building ReactQuizApp, I aimed to deepen my understanding of state management with Redux, improve my proficiency with React Router, and practice making efficient API requests with Axios. Additionally, styling the application with Sass helped me to create a modular and maintainable codebase. This project is a learning endeavor to become more adept at developing comprehensive web applications.
